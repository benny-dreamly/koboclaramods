However, we put strong emphasis on test-driven development.
Every PR is tested with an extensive <a href="test/suites">suite</a> of integration tests.
Vast majority of tests run on KV1 and KV2 and every test runs against vault <code>1.0.0</code> and <code>1.6.2</code>, i.e., vault versions in between should also be compatible.</p>

<h2>Contributions</h2>

<p>Contributions in any form are always welcome! Without contributions from the community, <code>vsh</code> wouldn't be the tool it is today.</p>

<h3>Local Development</h3>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>golang</code> (compiled and tested with <code>v1.15.7</code>)</li>
<li><code>docker</code> for integration testing</li>
<li><code>make</code> for simplified commands</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
make compile
make get-bats
make integration-tests
</code></p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p><code>-v DEBUG</code> sets debug log level, which also creates a <code>vsh_trace.log</code> file to log any error object from the vault API.</p>
