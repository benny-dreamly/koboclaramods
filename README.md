### This is a sort-of complete list of basic mods to help you start modding your Kobo Clara HD.

##### Here is a list of mostly pre-compiled mods that are included in this package:
* drop.zip = zip file with fully compiled version of Dropbear to enable SSH on the Clara HD.
* config.guess = script to help identifiy the architecture of the Clara HD.
* master = branch with compiler included
  * gcc-lin = compiler to help you compile Dropbear if you wish.

***There is another branch with a compiler to help you compile Dropbear from scratch if you wish.***
